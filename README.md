# Small project for studying MongoDb

## I installed the **Docker** app to pull a mongodb container into my system
I ran **docker run --name mongodb - p 37017:27017 -d mongodb** into docker. 
Then I used **port 3017** to setup my database to mongodb

## I then installed **MongoDb Compass** for managing my databases and tables.



## crudOperations
This folder is for applying each CRUD operations for a mongodb database.
run.js is for testing the connection to mongodb.

## src
This folder contains the class I used for a single student. It contains methods for each CRUD operation.

# Do cd crudOperations then run node *filename* into the command line terminal to run an operation.
